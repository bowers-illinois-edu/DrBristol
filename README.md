# DrBristol

A set of functions to compute $p$-values and perform sensitivity analysis, adapting Fisher’s $p$-value test to case studies and process tracing. It uses unbiased and biased urn models to draw null distributions in the absence of randomization.

# Name of the Package

We name our package after Dr. Murial Bristol, better known as “the tea lady” in Fisher’s $p$-value demonstration. Fewer people are aware that the “lady” was a fellow researcher of his at the Rothamsted Research institute. Beyond being a brilliant scientist herself, Dr. Bristol could indeed taste whether tea or milk were poured first into a cup, or so evidence suggests.
