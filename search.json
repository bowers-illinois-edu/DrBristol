You would over-state your evidence against the rivals if we used a multivariate null-model by repeating the same number of anti-Rival observations. We are reporting here the p-value from the find_p_multi_max_p command. If you actually do have multiple types of observations but happen to have the same numbers of them, then you should try this command again but set check_evidence=FALSE and messages=FALSE #> [1] 0.05011704"},{"path":"https://bowers-illinois-edu.github.io/DrBristol/reference/sens_obs_two_types.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Sensitivity analysis for urn models with two types of information — sens_obs_two_types","title":"Sensitivity analysis for urn models with two types of information — sens_obs_two_types","text":"function allows researcher calculate odds drawing working theory supporting observation rival theory supporting observation required increase p-value certain value.","code":""},{"path":"https://bowers-illinois-edu.github.io/DrBristol/reference/sens_obs_two_types.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Sensitivity analysis for urn models with two types of information — sens_obs_two_types","text":"","code":"sens_obs_two_types(   obs_support,   total_obs,   rival_obs = NULL,   weights = NULL,   p_threshold = 0.05 )"},{"path":"https://bowers-illinois-edu.github.io/DrBristol/reference/sens_obs_two_types.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Sensitivity analysis for urn models with two types of information — sens_obs_two_types","text":"obs_support integer representing number observations favor working hypothesis.
